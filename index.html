<h1>HELLO  wrold</h1>
<p>With the growth of the information security field in recent years has come dramatic
growth in the field of ethical hacking, also known as white hat (good guy) hacking.
Ethical hacking is the practice of attempting to infiltrate and exploit a system in order
to find out its weaknesses and better secure it. I segment the field of ethical hacking
into two primary components: penetration testing for a legitimate information security
firm and working for your nationâ€™s military or intelligence agencies. Both are rapidly
growing areas, and demand is strong.
